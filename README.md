Operating System Simulator

This project is designed to simulate an operating system on bare bones level. The simulator takes in a configuration file and a metadata file with processes and will schedule the processes according to the config file's scheduler. These can include First Come First Served - Non-Preemptive, Shortest Job First - Non-Preemptive, Shortest Time Remaining First - Preemptive, First Come First Served - Preemptive, and Round Robin - Preemptive. Each process will run concurrently and show the time remaining as well as the current I/O and CPU operations.
